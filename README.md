# SC1015-Mini-Project
 
About
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on variables affecting aviation flight incident.  

Project involves:
1. Data Extraction
2. Data Cleaning
3. Explorative Data Analysis
4. Machine Learning with classifier tree and random forests
5. Data driven insights

Problem Definition
To identify the factor that has the most impact on aviation incident.

Which variables would be the best to predict it?
1.Selected Data sets
2.Event Date
3.Location
4.Country
5.Company
6.Number of Engines
7.Injury Severity
8.Total Fatal Injuries
9.Weather Condition
10.Broad phase of flight
11.Investigation Type

CONCLUSION

WEATHER CONDITION HAS THE GREATEST IMPACT ON AVIATION INCIDENT
IT IS HARD TO PREDICT AND REQUIRE CONSISTENT MONITORING USE MACHINE LEARNING MODELS TO BETTER PREDICT WEATHER CONDITIONS
WITH BETTER WEATHER PREDICTION AIRLINES CAN MAKE MORE INFORMED DECISIONS AND PILOTS CAN BE MORE WARY OF MORE SUITABLE FLIGHT PATHS

What did we learn from this project?
How to apply machine learning techniques such as random forest classifier to generate a better decision tree model and to identify which variables has the most significant impact on aviation flight incidents.
