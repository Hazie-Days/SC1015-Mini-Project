# SC1015 Data Science Project - Aviation Accidents
 

- This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on variables affecting aviation flight incident.  
- To use Jupyter Notebook to conduct Machine Learning.

## Project involves:
1. Data Extraction
2. Data Cleaning
3. Explorative Data Analysis
4. Machine Learning with classifier tree and random forests
5. Data driven insights

## Contributors
- @farrelkoh13 - Machine learning, Statistical inference
- @WongXiangRui - Data analysis, Presenter 
- @William0498 - Data cleaning, Problem formulation

## Problem Definition
To identify factors that have the most impact on aviation accident.

## Algorithm used
- Confusion Matrix
- Decision Tree Regression 
- Random Forest Regression

## Which variables would be the best to predict it?
1. Selected Data sets
2. Event Date
3. Location
4. Country
5. Company
6. Number of Engines
7. Injury Severity
8. Total Fatal Injuries
9. Weather Condition
10. Broad phase of flight
11. Investigation Type

## CONCLUSION
WEATHER CONDITION HAS THE GREATEST IMPACT ON AVIATION INCIDENT
IT IS HARD TO PREDICT AND REQUIRE CONSISTENT MONITORING USE MACHINE LEARNING MODELS TO BETTER PREDICT WEATHER CONDITIONS
WITH BETTER WEATHER PREDICTION AIRLINES CAN MAKE MORE INFORMED DECISIONS AND PILOTS CAN BE MORE WARY OF MORE SUITABLE FLIGHT PATHS

## What did we learn from this project?
How to apply machine learning techniques such as random forest classifier to generate a better decision tree model and to identify which variables has the most significant impact on aviation flight incidents.
